# Business Analytics: Marketing and Decisions 
### 1. Cosmetics Purchases
The data shown in Table 14.14 and the output in Table 14.15 are
based on a subset of a dataset on cosmetic purchases (Cosmetics.csv) at a large chain
drugstore.
The store wants to analyze associations among purchases of these items for purposes of
point-of-sale display, guidance to sales personnel in promoting cross-sales, and guidance
for piloting an eventual time-of-purchase electronic recommender system to boost crosssales. Consider first only the data shown in Table 14.14, given in binary matrix form.

### 2. Course ratings.
The Institute for Statistics Education at Statistics.com asks students to
rate a variety of aspects of a course as soon as the student completes it. The Institute is
contemplating instituting a recommendation system that would provide students with
recommendations for additional courses as soon as they submit their rating for a
completed course. Consider the excerpt from student ratings of online statistics courses
shown in Table 14.16, and the problem of what to recommend to student E.N.

### 3. Clustering
Use the “movieLens.txt” data in Lecture 3 and perform cluster analysis of the
1664 non-duplicate movies.
